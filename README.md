# Missing Migrants

## Summary about the Missing Migrants Project
The Missing Migrants Project is an initiative aimed at collecting and analyzing data on migrants who have died or gone missing during the process of migration. Managed by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the project brings together a variety of sources, including media reports, government records, and interviews, to provide a comprehensive look at the risks and challenges faced by migrants worldwide. The data is intended to inform policy, raise awareness, and serve as a resource for further research. https://missingmigrants.iom.int/

## Datasets

The primary dataset used across these notebooks originates from the Missing Migrants Project, which tracks incidents involving migrants, including refugees and asylum-seekers, who have died or gone missing in the process of migration towards an international destination.

## Visualizations

All the plots and visualizations generated during the analysis are stored in the `Pictures` folder. This includes:

- Geospatial visualizations showcasing incident locations.
- Bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs illustrating various metrics and distributions.
- Heatmaps and cluster plots highlighting hotspots and concentrations of incidents.

To view the visualizations:

1. Navigate to the `Pictures` folder in the repository.
2. Open the desired image file to view the visualization.
