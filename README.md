# Missing Migrants

## Summary about the Missing Migrants Project
The Missing Migrants Project is an initiative aimed at collecting and analyzing data on migrants who have died or gone missing during the process of migration. Managed by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the project brings together a variety of sources, including media reports, government records, and interviews, to provide a comprehensive look at the risks and challenges faced by migrants worldwide. The data is intended to inform policy, raise awareness, and serve as a resource for further research.
